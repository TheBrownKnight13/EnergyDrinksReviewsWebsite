They had some incredible flavors and with an incredible 300 mg of caffeine per can, they were an excellent choice to start off one's day during a slow morning or a bad night's sleep. The cotton candy flavored Bang was one of my favorites, and I only recently saw it back on shelves when shopping at Weis for a grocery haul. I excitedly grabbed a can knowing that this was going to make for an incredible Sunday morning.</p> <p>And it did not disappoint. The cotton candy flavor was exactly how I remembered it. There's a wonderful sweetness to the drink but it's also not overpowering. I'm personally a huge fan of candy flavored drinks (other favorites of mine include C4's Skittles and Starburst flavored drinks). Bang perfectly captured the cotton candy flavor in this one and each sip leaves you wanting more.</p> <p>And of course the best part of Bang drinks is the insane kick. I'm someone who likes to slowly sip on energy drinks and space out the caffeine rush. Despite that, I felt the power of the drink very quickly. Perfect drink to get you going for a busy day ahead in my opinion. The comedown isn't as bad as other drinks as well, leaving you enough energy for later in the day when the kick wears off. This drink is one of my absolute favorites and I am giving Bang Cotton Candy a score of 9.2 out of 10.</p>"},{"location":"reviews/2024/07/07/bang-sour-heads/","title":"Bang Sour Heads","text":"<p>Score: 4.5 / 10</p> <p></p> <p>Today I am reviewing the Bang Sour Heads energy drink. Bang is of course one of the stronger energy drinks out there at a whopping 300 mg of caffeine per can. I (try to) stay away from these drinks unless I feel like I really need it for whatever reason, lack of sleep, etc.</p> <p>I came in not sure if I would like this drink as I'm usually not a fan of sour drinks. I prefer the candy flavored drinks like C4 Skittles / Starburst or Bang's Cotton Candy. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste upon the first sip as I didn't find the sour taste overwhelming. It did have a strong fizz and taste which took some getting used to. The best comparison I can make for describing the sour-ness is probably to Sour Skittles.</p> <p>One unfortunate thing I found is that the sour taste and the flavor of the can went away very quickly. The first quarter of the can had a strong flavor to it but after making my way through the can, the taste almost completely went away. The rest of the can tasted unfortunately very close to lemon water. This was disappointing as other Bang drinks I have tried have not suffered from this problem. For this, I am knocking off several points off my review.</p> <p>The 300mg of caffeine in the can redeems it somewhat and despite the taste wearing off, the energy boost off the can was insane. Felt absolutely wired for a morning workout and so far has not dropped off. However, in the future I would prefer and recommend Bang's Cotton Candy as opposed to this Bang Sour Heads drink.</p>"},{"location":"reviews/2024/07/14/beyond-raw-lit-jolly-rancher-blue-raspberry/","title":"Beyond Raw Lit Jolly Rancher Blue Raspberry","text":"<p>Score: 8.1 / 10</p> <p></p> <p>Welcome back loyal fans. I'm glad to announce I have returned after a long hiatus. This morning I tested Beyond Raw Lit's Jolly Rancher Blue Rasberry energy drink. Back when I used to take preworkout, I loved Beyond Raw Lit's different preworkouts. Beyond Lit Raw always packed a bunch of beta alanine in their preworkouts and that stuff makes it feel like there's ants crawling all over your face. Which feels awesome.</p> <p>Their energy drinks are in a similar vein. Beyond Lit Raw Jolly Rancher Blue Rasberry has 250 mg of caffeine which is pretty high but not at Bang and Reign levels which go to 300 mg. However despite not having as much caffeine, Beyond Raw Lit contains much more beta alanine which adds to the experience. That's why, in my humble opinion, despite not having as much caffeine as the big boys of Bang and Reign, Beyond Raw Lit provides a stronger kick.</p> <p>The taste is also of decent quality as well. I don't think it tastes exactly like a blue Jolly Rancher, however it does resemble it. You can definitely tell what they were trying to go for. It does have a nice sweetness to it that doesn't fade away after you reach the end of the can. Overall, I think it's an excellent drink choice that I would recommend before a workout of some kind, not for anything that requires sitting still. </p> <p>It is one of the pricier options out there, as I procured this can at GNC for 3 dollars. That being said, I think it's an overall very high quality drink that has a good taste. 8.1 / 10</p>"},{"location":"reviews/2024/07/14/black-rifles-rich-mocha-coffee/","title":"Black Rifle Rich Mocha Coffee","text":"<p>Score: 9.6 / 10</p> <p></p> <p>This week's review is a special July 4th edition (a little late, I know). Today I am reviewing Black Rifle's Rich Mocha Coffee. Black Rifle's branding is absolutely on point with a giant american flag on the can along with a slogan of \"serving coffee and culture to people who love America\" and a warning of \"300 mg of freedom fuel\". Excellent stuff.</p> <p>It's worth noting that some energy drink traditionalists argue that coffee based drinks should not count as energy drinks and I have mixed feelings on this topic. Perhaps a discussion for another time.</p> <p>As I patriotically sipped my Black Rifle Coffee, my first thought was that it was absolutely delicious. I'm not usually a coffee person but this coffee has a wonderful creaminess and flavor to it. The \"Rich Mocha\" label did not disappoint and the taste was exactly such. For coffee lovers who are not big energy drink fans I think that this can be a great gateway into the energy drink world.</p> <p>I found the energy hit of this can to be absolutely insane. Downed the drink with no breakfast first thing on a Sunday morning, and felt like my head was going to explode. Whatever is in this \"freedom fuel\" is some powerful stuff. Highly recommend this drink, Black Rifle Coffee has become one of my absolute favorites.</p>"},{"location":"reviews/2024/11/03/c4-jolly-rancher/","title":"C4 Jolly Rancher","text":"<p>Score: 7.4 / 10</p> <p></p> <p>Welcome back energy drink fans, I'm glad to say I have returned after a long hiatus to drop a review. This week, I'm reviewing the C4 Jolly Rancher drink. This edition was just recently released by C4 just earlier this year in August. C4 seems to be poised to take over the energy drink X candy collab market. C4 has existing partnerships/flavors with their Starburst edition, Skittles edition, and Popsicle edition drink and now adds Jolly Rancher to the mix.</p> <p>It's worth noting that C4 isn't the only energy drink brand that collabs with Jolly Rancher, Beyond Raw Lit also has drinks with Jolly Rancher. I've previously reviewed one of these drinks (Beyond Raw Lit Rancher Blue Raspberry) from Beyond Raw and have had a very favorable opinion of it (8.1 / 10) This Jolly Rancher drink by C4 goes for the green Jolly Rancher taste unlike the Beyond Raw Lit one which goes for the blue one.</p> <p>I thought that as far as matching the drink taste to the actual candy, C4 does a pretty good job with this one. It tastes very close to how I remember green Jolly Ranchers tasting. That being said I didn't like it as much as I liked Beyond Raw Lit's Jolly Rancher drink. However, that could be because I like blue Jolly Ranchers over the green ones.</p> <p>Still, taste wise it was still quite good and it hit the spot. This drink's caffeine content comes in at around 200 mgs. It packs a decent kick especially since I've been having less caffeine as of late and it is definitely a great way to start a morning. Overall I'm reasonably happy with this drink and I would give it a 7.4 rating out of 10.</p>"},{"location":"reviews/2024/06/08/c4-starburst/","title":"C4 Starburst","text":"<p>Score: 8.2 / 10</p> <p></p> <p>Hello all, I know it's been a while since I dropped my last review. Between travel and life stuff I just haven't had the time to write. I'm excited to come back hot with this review of C4's Starburst flavored energy drink.</p> <p>I remember brands like C4 and Ghost more so for their pre-workout and it's interesting seeing them expand in the energy drink market. Despite being newcomers to the energy drink game with existing major players (Red Bull, Monster, etc) I feel like C4 and Ghost have been much more innovative in terms of flavors. C4 in particular has been great with flavors, my favorites being Starburst and Skittles flavored (skittles review coming later) drinks.</p> <p>The C4 Starburst drink tastes absolutely delicious. For those who like Starburst, I think C4 did a very good job in matching the taste of the pink starburst candy. The taste is sweet but not overpowering. There's no foul aftertaste and it goes down very smoothly. I'm also increasing the score because of the energy kick the drink gives. C4 drinks don't go crazy on the caffeine, this can only has 200mg, but their drinks still hit pretty good even if you're a caffeine junkie. I'm guessing it's because of the beta alanine they add, I'd be curious to see if they add a lot more beta alanine than other brands (although I don't feel like researching this at the moment). I definitely feel the facial tingles after half a can of the C4 Starburst and it's a great way to start off your day. Excellentexperience - 8.2 / 10.</p>"},{"location":"reviews/2024/05/18/celsius-oasis-vibe/","title":"Celsius Oasis Vibe","text":"<p>Score: 5.4 / 10</p> <p></p> <p>For full clarity, this review is of the Celsius Oasis Vibe \"Sparkling Prickly Pear Lime\" Edition. I'm not aware if there are other Celsius Oasis Vibe editions and I do not feel like researching it.</p> <p>This can is among the mixed variety pack of Celsius drinks I got so I could review a variety of Celsius drinks. Unfortunately, I got busy with life stuff and haven't reviewed the other Celsius drinks so apologies to the readers. I will come back and review those at a future date.</p> <p>This can of Celsius has a catchy title and can design. It's definitely one of the more visually appealing cans I have seen. Points given for that.</p> <p>The taste didn't have a very strong kick to it, I had to really focus on the taste to pick it up. Upon focusing on it, I could taste the hints of the pear and lime. I don't personally like most fruits including pear and lime so I didn't expect to like the flavor however I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor combination agreed with my taste buds and I wasn't mad at it. However, I wouldn't say the taste was very memorable and I will remember this one more for the can design.</p>"},{"location":"reviews/2024/05/01/celsius-strawberry-lemonade/","title":"Celsius Strawberry Lemonade","text":"<p>Score: 4.0 / 10</p> <p></p> <p>Celsius is a brand I am generally a fan of. I don't get their drinks very often (Rockstar is what I usually get) however I do acknowledge that they do a good job with having a wide variety of flavors. I ordered a pack of assorted Celsius drinks off Amazon so I could try a bunch of different flavors. So to all of this website's dedicated fans (all three of you), expect the next set of reviews to be of different Celsius flavors for the coming few weeks.</p> <p>The one that I first tried is the strawberry lemonade flavor. I thought the flavor was... ok. I'll admit I don't generally like strawberry and lemonade that much so this flavor never had a huge change of me giving it a high score. This drink to me had a much stronger lemonade flavor and I only caught hints of strawberry while I was sipping it. Although I don't like strawberry or lemonade I would have preferred a stronger strawberry taste than lemonade.</p> <p>Of all the flavors Celsius has I think this one is one of the weaker ones in their repertoire. If you are a person who loves lemonade and strawberries you might love this one but in my opinion, Celsius has much better flavors out there. Can't speak to the energy kick as I'm only halfway through the can while writing this review but usually Celsius gives a decent hit (though not as much as Reign/Bang of course). For these reasons I must sadly give Celsius Strawberry Lemonade a mere 4 out of 10.</p>"},{"location":"reviews/2025/01/24/g-fuel-watermelon-limeade/","title":"G Fuel Watermelon Limeade","text":"<p>Score: 5.2 / 10</p> <p></p> <p>Good evening everyone. Today I am reviewing the G Fuel Watermelon Limeade energy drink. This drink was specifically requested by a reader of this site for review. Lately I have been consuming less caffeine than usual (around 200 mg a day), so I was excited to try the can of G Fuel Watermelon Limeade coming in at a whopping 300 mg of caffeine. G Fuel is a brand that I do not try very often - when I was consuming energy drinks around this caffeine range, I would normally choose the drinks by Reign or Bang. However, I have previously tried G Fuel's Cherry Lollipop Pacman drink (unreviewed) and thought it was quite good.</p> <p>When I started drinking this can of G Fuel Watermelon Limeade, my initial thoughts were the flavor was relatively bland. It was not unpleasant, in fact I do enjoy a nice watermelon flavor. However I couldn't really taste much and I had to focus to get the hints of watermelon and limeade in this drink. I thought this was quite odd since normally energy drink flavors are much more pronounced. That was the biggest disappointment to me, since I was expecting a little bit more from this drink.</p> <p>Despite the lack of a strong taste, the energy boost coming from the can was quite impressive. I could feel my legs shaking once I got a third of the way through the can. For where my caffeine tolerance was at the moment I would say the energy kick wasn't ideal for sitting down and doing office work - since the energy kick was a bit stronger than ideal. However, for a workout or any kind of physical activity I would recommend this can for that (although there are certainly ones with a similar punch that provide a better taste in my opinion). The energy crash in the afternoon from the drink was quite strong as well and I definitely had to go through a bit of a slump.</p> <p>My overall thoughts is that this energy drink certainly has its utility for certain situations but I think there are just better tasting cans out there that provide a similar punch. I would not recommend to my readers to buy this can as a daily driver.</p>"},{"location":"reviews/2024/06/23/ghost-sour-patch-blue-raspberry/","title":"Ghost Sour Patch Blue Raspberry","text":"<p>Score: 2.9 / 10</p> <p></p> <p>This Sunday morning, I taste tested the Ghost Sour Patch Blue Raspberry energy drink. I came in with high expectations since other flavors of Ghost I've tried (orange cream and faze pop) have been absolutely delicious. Ghost generally has a good kick to it despite a modest 200 mg of caffeine.</p> <p>However, with Ghost Sour Patch Blue Rasberry I was severely disappointed. I am generally a fan of candy flavored drinks (C4 Starburst and C4 Skittles especially) but the sour patch flavor did not agree with me. I do like the actual sour patch candy but to me this drink did not accurately reflect the flavor of Sour Patch. I also like the taste of raspberries, they are one of only two fruits I actually like, the other being blueberries. Ghost Sour Patch Blue Rasberry was a poor reflection of both flavors they were trying to imitate. The combination of these two flavors did not mix well together.</p> <p>The only redeeming factor of this drink is the solid energy kick it gave. The beta alanine in Ghost drinks does a good job of making it feel like your face is being constantly pricked by the time you're halfway through the can. Despite that, Ghost has missed the mark with this flavor and I am giving this drink a 2.9 out of 10.</p>"},{"location":"reviews/2024/12/08/monster-aussie-lemonade/","title":"Monster Aussie Lemonade","text":"<p>Score: 1.8 / 10</p> <p></p> <p>Good morning everyone. Today I am reviewing the Monster Aussie Lemonade energy drink. This drink was specifically requested from a fan's recommendation - so I stopped by a WaWa's and found this drink to review. Researching this drink on Monster's website, their description of this drink is as follows - \"Inspired by the land down under and powered by our world-famous Monster Energy blend, Aussie Style Lemonade is a carbonated exotic twist on lemonade. Tart yet sweet, with a burst of fresh citrus flavor.\" Interestingly, I also discovered that this flavor of Monster will be discontinued soon and will be going away sometime in 2025.</p> <p>Looking at the can, I think this is one of the most eye popping designs I have ever seen. There are a number of sea creatures with a bright blue background that are fun to look at. Looking at the can's nutrition label - I noticed this can has 46 grams of sugar. I usually review and drink sugar free energy drinks (with the rare exception of Rockstar Fruit Punch) so I thought this would be an interesting one to review.</p> <p>When I took my first sip of this can, I was absolutely horrified. I thought the flavor was extremely unpleasant. The combination of the lemonade flavoring which was a little sour combined with the sugar in the drink did not go well together. The first initial taste I got from each sip was a sour kick and then followed up by the sweet aftertaste. Unfortunately, I was not able to finish this drink as I did not enjoy it. I understand why it is being discontinued. For these reasons, I am giving this drink a score of 1.8 out of 10.</p>"},{"location":"reviews/2024/05/05/monster-ultra-strawberry-dreams/","title":"Monster Ultra Strawberry Dreams","text":"<p>Score: 7.8 / 10</p> <p></p> <p>When walking down the self checkout lines at Target, the Monster Ultra Strawberry Dream energy drink can caught my eye. It was a bright pink can with an aesthetically pleasing design. My fish brain was instantly attracted to it and between that and the pressure of my many fans (all three of them) clamoring for a new review, I knew I had to buy it.</p> <p>When I first took a sip, I was... pleasantly surprised. If the fans read my last review on the Celsius Strawberry lemonade, they'll know that I'm not the biggest fan of strawberry flavored things. Despite that, I thought the taste of Monster Ultra Strawberry Dreams was pretty damn good. The light strawberry kick left a pleasant taste in my mouth and I wanted to down the rest of it immediately.</p> <p>I will say I enjoyed this flavor of Monster better than most of the other flavors of theirs I tried and this is a can that I would get again. The main drawback for me is the lack of kick to it. This can contains a mere 110mg of caffeine per can..slightly more than a cup of coffee. If you have a serious caffeine addiction like me, that is just not going to cut it. That's why I'm docking a few points off the score.</p> <p>That being said, overall this is an excellent drink. The can was aesthetically pleasing (which does factor into my review in case anyone is wondering) and the taste was pretty good. 7.8 out of 10 for me, would buy again.</p>"},{"location":"reviews/2024/11/11/monster-ultra-vice-guava/","title":"Monster Ultra Vice Guava","text":"<p>Score: 7.0 / 10</p> <p></p> <p>Good morning everyone. In this edition of energy drink reviews, I am responding to a fan request to review the recently released Monster Ultra Vice Guava energy drink. This is the newest drink in Monster's Ultra Line and only recently was put in stores several months ago. Monster now has quite a few drinks in their \"Ultra\" line, which offers a lighter tasting sugar-free version than the regular Monster. I have previously reviewed the Monster Ultra Strawberry Dreams and remain a big fan of that drink.</p> <p>Moving on to the Ultra Vice Guava, the can design (see picture) is eye popping and quite aesthetically pleasing. The caffeine content of this drink comes in at 150 mgs. In my personal opinion, the energy boost off Monsters takes longer to kick in than other energy drinks- possibly because of the can's large size which takes longer to consume.</p> <p>The taste was quite interesting. I thought the first few initial sips of the can were quite harsh and tasted a little off. But after these first few sips, the taste was a smooth guava flavor that was quite pleasant. I do not normally like guava flavor, but this drink made me reconsider that notion. Overall I would say I had a very enjoyable experience sipping this can. I would recommend this drink for a lazy weekend morning because of the longer time needed for the energy hit. For more strenuous activity I would start looking in the 200 mg+ caffeine range (Ghost, Celsius, C4, Alani, etc). Overall score - 7.0 / 10.</p>"},{"location":"reviews/2024/06/30/rockstar-fruit-punch/","title":"Rockstar Fruit Punch","text":"<p>Score: 7.5 / 10</p> <p></p> <p>This morning I tested the Rockstar Fruit Punch Zero energy drink. This is a drink that I've had a number of times before and is one of my go-tos. Rockstar is one of those brands that goes for cheaper than the other big brands like Red Bull and Monster which is why I primarily roll with Rockstar for my daily drink. Of all the Rockstar flavors, I personally love Grape the best, then Silver Ice and Fruit Punch next.</p> <p>Taste wise, Rockstar Fruit Punch is quite good. You're getting exactly what the can is advertising. To me, it tastes pretty much exactly like fruit punch. If you like fruit punch, you will like this drink. Not much else to say about it. One caveat to add is that this review if for the zero sugar one, I have tasted the Rockstar Fruit Punch with sugar and I do think the sugared one is a little bit better.</p> <p>Caffeine content in this one definitely packs a punch at 240 mg of caffeine. More than Celsis / Ghost (200 mg) and less than Reign / Bang (300 mg) so it's a good middle ground there. Enough to get you going for the day but enough to have you bouncing off the walls. Overall, pretty solid drink and a decent option for a daily go-to. Giving this one a 7.5 / 10.</p>"},{"location":"reviews/2024/04/27/rockstar-grape-zero-sugar/","title":"Rockstar Grape Zero Sugar","text":"<p>Score: 7.8 / 10</p> <p></p> <p>Rockstar Grape Zero is... pretty damn good. If you like grape flavored things, you're gonna love this one. Rockstar is one of those drinks in my opinion that always flies under the radar below Monster and Red Bull. Which is strange to me since Rockstar usually goes for a buck or sometimes two depending on where you live.</p> <p>This drink definitely packs a solid punch at 240 mgs of caffeine. Definitely a solid go-to on days where I haven't had enough sleep. The odd thing though is despite having more caffeine than drinks like C4, it doesn't pack as hard a punch as C4. But still... definitely strong enough of a kick to get you going in the morning.</p> <p>Taste itself will be hit or miss depending on if you like grape flavored stuff. I'm definitely a huge fan of grape flavored things, so I really like this one. There is definitely a bit of an artificial taste there but it doesn't bother me. I'm giving this drink a 7.8 / 10.</p>"},{"location":"reviews/archive/2025/","title":"2025","text":""},{"location":"reviews/archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"reviews/category/g-fuel/","title":"G Fuel","text":""},{"location":"reviews/category/monster/","title":"Monster","text":""},{"location":"reviews/category/c4/","title":"C4","text":""},{"location":"reviews/category/beyond-raw/","title":"Beyond Raw","text":""},{"location":"reviews/category/black-rifle/","title":"Black Rifle","text":""},{"location":"reviews/category/bang/","title":"Bang","text":""},{"location":"reviews/category/rockstar/","title":"Rockstar","text":""},{"location":"reviews/category/ghost/","title":"Ghost","text":""},{"location":"reviews/category/celsius/","title":"Celsius","text":""},{"location":"reviews/page/2/","title":"Reviews","text":""},{"location":"reviews/archive/2024/page/2/","title":"2024","text":""}]}
