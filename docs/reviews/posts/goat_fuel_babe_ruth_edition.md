	Good morning loyal fans - I have returned after a long hiatus to drop a review on the Goat Fuel ‘Babe Ruth Edition’ Blueberry Lemonade flavored drink. For those who are unaware, Goat Fuel is the energy drink brand started by the ex-football star Jerry Rice back in 2019. There are different Goat Fuel editions including a Jerry Rice edition, a Muhammad Ali edition, and as of recently - a Babe Ruth edition. I have previously had the Jerry Rice edition (unreviewed) and thought it was pretty mid. 

	I discovered this can of Babe Ruth Goat Fuel at a Giant grocery store where I paid 3 dollars and 29 cents (before sales taxes) to purchase this can. This can is most certainly on the pricier side coming in higher than the big names of Red Bull, Monster, Rockstar, and Celsius. The can design has a nice clean design with a picture of Babe Ruth on it swinging a baseball bat. 
	
 	Along with the standard ingredients that many energy drinks have that I’m sure (disclaimer - I am not a doctor and am not giving medical advice) are extremely healthy for everyone such as taurine, ascorbic acid, and L-Leucine - this edition of Goat Fuel interestingly has cordyceps mushroom powder. I have not seen that ingredient used in other energy drinks I have seen. A quick chat gpt search told me that this ingredient is helpful for energy, immune support, and stamina.
	
 	Now moving on to taste - I thought the flavor was generally as advertised. The flavor description was blueberry lemonade and the taste of the drink was blueberry lemonade. I am not a huge lemonade fan and I would not say it is a flavor I really loved, however I can see other people really liking this one. For me, it was just alright. There interestingly isn’t as much fizz in this drink compared to many of the other big names in the game at the moment. 
	
 	The energy kick off the can was pretty decent though. I felt my eyes bulging out of my head once I got halfway through the can. Perhaps it was the mushroom powder they put in. Regardless, for the price and unspectacular taste, I wouldn’t recommend this can as a daily driver. I am giving it a score of 4.8 / 10.
