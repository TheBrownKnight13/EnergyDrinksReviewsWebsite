Celsius is a brand I am generally a fan of. I don't get their drinks very often (Rockstar is what I usually get) however I do acknowledge that they do a good job with having a wide variety of flavors. I ordered a pack of assorted Celsius drinks off Amazon so I could try a bunch of different flavors. So to all of this website's dedicated fans (all three of you), expect the next set of reviews to be of different Celsius flavors for the coming few weeks.

The one that I first tried is the strawberry lemonade flavor. I thought the flavor was... ok. I'll admit I don't generally like strawberry and lemonade that much so this flavor never had a huge change of me giving it a high score. This drink to me had a much stronger lemonade flavor and I only caught hints of strawberry while I was sipping it. Although I don't like strawberry or lemonade I would have preferred a stronger strawberry taste than lemonade.

Of all the flavors Celsius has I think this one is one of the weaker ones in their repertoire. If you are a person who loves lemonade and strawberries you might love this one but in my opinion, Celsius has much better flavors out there. Can't speak to the energy kick as I'm only halfway through the can while writing this review but usually Celsius gives a decent hit (though not as much as Reign/Bang of course). For these reasons I must sadly give Celsius Strawberry Lemonade a mere 4 out of 10.
