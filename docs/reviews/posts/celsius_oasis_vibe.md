For full clarity, this review is of the Celsius Oasis Vibe *"Sparkling Prickly Pear Lime"* Edition. I'm not aware if there are
other Celsius Oasis Vibe editions and I do not feel like researching it.

This can is among the mixed variety pack of Celsius drinks I got so I could review a variety of Celsius drinks. Unfortunately, I got busy with life stuff and haven't reviewed the other Celsius drinks so apologies to the readers. I will come back and review those at a future date.

This can of Celsius has a catchy title and can design. It's definitely one of the more visually appealing cans I have seen. Points given for that.

The taste didn't have a very strong kick to it, I had to really focus on the taste to pick it up. Upon focusing on it, I could taste the hints of the pear and lime. I don't personally like most fruits including pear and lime so I didn't expect to like the flavor however I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor combination agreed with my taste buds and I wasn't mad at it. However, I wouldn't say the taste was very memorable and I will remember this one more for the can design.
